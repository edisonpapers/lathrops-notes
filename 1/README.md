# 1 Pen Notes

Edison wrote this set with ink on eight pages.  The editors have arranged the text in the way that seems to provide the greatest internal coherence, starting with the items that Edison numbered. This page sequence differs from that created earlier by an archivist. To see more information about the notes, hover over underlined words or letters in the transcript on the left.
- <span style="color:red">*X*</span> indicates a note by Lathrop that he wanted Edison to return to, and provide more information. 
- Lathrop’s marginalia and underlining made in <span style="color:red">*red*</span> pencil unless marked otherwise. 
- Some paragraphs are followed by dividing marks. 
- Marginalia by Edison unless marked otherwise. 
- Some words have been overwritten and obscured, specifically Edison's **OK** over some of the notes.

At his iron mine in  Ogden, New Jersy, was a “body of ore one mile long standing nearly perpendicular and extending down into the bowels of the earth . . . containing several hundred million tons of magnetic material” By running several miles of wire on telegraph poles around this ore bed, he planned to create “an inductive circuit” that would respond to disturbances of the earth’s magnetism and “by the use of the telephone <u>all sounds produced on the sun would be heard</u> on our planet.” <i>TAED</i> LB043285 (<i>TAEB</i> 10: 366); see also “A Telephone to the Sun,” Locomotive Engineers’ Monthly Journal 24 (Dec. 1890): 913)."}. 100,000 hp steel wheel ==Penokee Range.=={description="Today this is designated as the Gogebic Range but is commonly referred to as the Penokee Range.

Tails comets repelled by magnet lines Tail being an electric stress in the ==ether=={description="Although Edison’s earliest specific reference to the ether is found in an 1888 notebook, his etheric force experiments clearly referenced the idea. The “ether” was posited to explain physical actions (such as magnetism or the transmission of light) across space without benefit of air or other perceptible conducting medium. Although ether was generally accepted as a necessary idea, the nineteenth century’s best scientific minds used the word with varying degrees of skepticism and literal-mindedness."} **OK**
