# F Notes

Edison wrote these notes in pen on two pages that he marked “10F” and “11F”; the other pages are missing. The text below appears in that order. 
- Some text is obscured by other writing, and some words are crossed out and corrected above. 
- Some paragraphs are followed by a dividing mark.

This page sequence differs from that created earlier by an archivist. To see more information about the notes, hover over underlined words or letters in the transcript on the left.
