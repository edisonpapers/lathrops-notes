# D Notes

Edison wrote these notes in pen on eleven pages that he marked “1D,” “2D,” etc. The text below appears in that order. 
- Some text is obscured by other writing, and some words are crossed out and corrected above. 
- Some paragraphs are followed by a dividing mark.

 The editors have arranged the text in the way that seems to provide the greatest internal coherence, starting with the items that Edison numbered. This page sequence differs from that created earlier by an archivist. To see more information about the notes, hover over underlined words or letters in the transcript on the left.

The horses of the rich had reached ==such=={description=" 'a' interlined above"} high degree of beauty, and Lines of beauty were as eagerly sought for as speed, and so high spirited had they become that safety appliances were in common use where such horses were used for family purposes. This consisted of an attachment to the head of a small sponge in the center of which was small brass reciptible whoses value was a controlled by a small cord fastened to the Carriage— The reciptable was filled with Nitrite of Amyl. When the horse became unmanageable the pulling of the string released the Amyl to the sponge and being directly over the nostrils of the horse The inhalation of the vapor caused the horse to almost instantly lose its strength and stop-

One of the most beautiful processes used in the arts was the plating of all kinds of objects, Cloth & in fact every material substance with films either very thick or of extreme attenuation, by ~~hanging Su~~ placing such articles in Vacuum chambers and when high vacua was reached Volatilizing the material to form the film by electrical incandescence. Every metal including those not possible to plate with by the use of a galvanic battery are perfectly ==plated.=={description=" 'Factories employ this process where' interlined above"} The finest & largest mirrors ~~are plated~~ are formed by the deposit on the glass of the Vapor of pure silver ~~on the g~~ So thin are the ==films=={description=" 'So thin…appear blue—' interlined above"} that if not taken from their frames & held up to the Light objects can be seen through the film which appear blue—i films of pure Silica, are thus deposited. ~~The reason the vapor of the metal or material is~~ Artificial

Gold Leaf and the same with other metals and materials are not made entirely by this process. The method of making the gold leaf being first the a deposit of a film of Zinc on glass over this gold then Zinc, until 200 films of gold have been deposited on a foot square on removal from the Vacuum the whole is immerse in weak sulphuric acid the Zinc is eaten away ==Leaving=={description="obscure, overwritten text"} the films of gold intact. These are ~~dried~~ dipped in Rigolene to displace the water & chemical products dried and cut to shape the film while no thicker than that made by the old process of beating gold between sheets of parchment has 30 times the strength and can be handled easily—

Mica for ~~sub stoves~~, for windows in place of glass which was used in enormous quantities is made by this process. The ingredients

which form mica being melted by electrical incandescence & the moment and portion becomes molten it flashes into vapor and passes in straight lines throughout the whole chamber depositing itself on any object which it may meet, and instantly solidifying—
By manipulation of the current there are periods of rest between each film. The absence of light ==causes=={description=" ' on' interlined above"} the surface of the previously deposited film produces a surface change of unknown character so that when the next film is flashed It does not subsequently adhere ==to=={description="overwritten text"} form one piece but is cleaverable like true Mica— ~~Q ~~Artificial Mica formed of Quartz glass and other transparant bodies fusible by electrical incandescence are made.

It is by this process that telescopic Lenses Eleven feet in diameter are made. The ~~rough~~ mould conforming roughly to the shape of the lense required forms the Vacuum Chamber. this is kept highly exhausted by a great number of Large Continuously acting Sprengel glass Vacuum pumps and the glass is melted by electrical incandense— in a small place at one Edge a very small portion of the glass being melted at any instant but the process is continuous and never stops for an instant until the lense is finished. The deposit goes on at the rate of 3 ounzes per minute. The lense is afterward ground in the

The rooms of the dwellings of the rich ~~were~~ had there walls inlaid with mother of pearl ~~made~~ which are now produced in sheets in every variety artificially= Natural mother of pearl has no Color of itself but the play of Colors are due to the diffraction of light by the layers of Lime of the shell. The shell grows by successive layers of carbonite of lime cemented by glutenous matter, being deposited. In the ~~man~~ factories where artificial mother of pearl is made, machinery performs this ==process. plates=={description=" 'innumerable' interlined above"} of both flat and in the most irrigular shape are dipped in and out of Vats containing Lime water and glutenous substance. The plates of which there are several though operated by one shaft causes the plates to dip through an ==orifice=={description=" ' through an orifice' interlined above"} in the vats then rise up through this orifice to a considerable
