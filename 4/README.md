# D Notes

Edison wrote these notes in pen on eleven pages that he marked “1D,” “2D,” etc. The text below appears in that order. Some text is obscured by other writing, and some words are crossed out and corrected above.

The horses of the rich had reached ==such=={description=" 'a' interlined above"} high degree of beauty, and Lines of beauty were as eagerly sought for as speed, and so high spirited had they become that safety appliances were in common use where such horses were used for family purposes. This consisted of an attachment to the head of a small sponge in the center of which was small brass reciptible whoses value was a controlled by a small cord fastened to the Carriage— The reciptable was filled with Nitrite of Amyl. When the horse became unmanageable the pulling of the string released the Amyl to the sponge and being directly over the nostrils of the horse The inhalation of the vapor caused the horse to almost instantly lose its strength and stop+

Mica has 
Gold Leaf and the same with other metals and materials are not made entirely by this process. The method of making the gold leaf being first the aa deposit of a film of Zinc on glass over this gold then Zinc, until 200 films of gold have been deposited on a foot square on removal from the Vacuum the whole is immerse in weak sulphuric acid the Zinc is eaten away Leavingf the films of gold intact. These are dried dipped in Rigolene to displace the water & chemical products dried and cut to shape the film while no thicker than that made by the old process of beating gold between sheets of parchment has 30 times the strength and can be handled easily—
Mica for sub stoves, for windows in place of glass whichf was used in enormousf quantities is made by this process. The ingredients

which form mica being melted by electrical incandescence & the moment and portion becomes molten it flashes into vapor and passes in straight lines throughout the whole chamber depositing itself on any object which it may meet, and instantly solidifying—
By manipulation of the current there are periods of rest between each film. The absence of light causes ona the surface of the previously deposited film produces a surface change of unknown character so that when the next film is flashed It does not subsequently adhere tof form one piece but is cleaverable like true Mica— Q Artificial Mica formed of Quartz glass and other transparant bodies fusible by electrical incandescence are made.

It is by this process that telescopic Lenses Eleven feet in diameter are made. The rough mould conforming roughly to the shape of the lensef required forms the Vacuum Chamber. this is kept highly exhausted by a great number of Large Continuously acting Sprengel glass Vacuum pumps and the glass is melted by electrical incandense— in a small place at one Edge a very small portion of the glass being melted at any instant but the process is continuous and never stops for an instant until the lense is finished. The deposit goes on at the rate of 3 ounzes per minute. The lense is afterward ground in the

The rooms of the dwellings of the rich were had there walls inlaid with mother of pearl made which are now produced in sheets in every variety artificially= Natural mother of pearl has no Color of itself but the play of Colors are due to the diffraction of light by the layers of Lime of the shell. The shell grows by successive layers of carbonite of lime cemented by glutenous matter, being deposited. In the man factories where artificial mother of pearl is made, machinery performs this process. innumerablea plates of both flat and in the most irrigular shape are dipped in and out of Vats containing Limef water and glutenous substance. The plates of which there are several though operated by one shaft causes the plates to dip through an orificej in the vatsf then rise up through this orifice to a considerable
